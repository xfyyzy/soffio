# Support Guidelines

English | [中文](SUPPORT.zh.md)

Need help or want to raise feedback? Pick the channel that best matches your situation.

## FAQ & Docs
- Start with `README.md` (plus any docs under `docs/`) for installation, configuration, and runtime details.
- If something is missing or inaccurate, please open an Issue or send a PR to improve it.

## Bugs / Technical Issues
1. Search existing Issues to avoid duplicates.
2. When filing a new bug, use the “Bug report” template and include logs, configs, and reproduction steps.
3. Never disclose security vulnerabilities in public Issues—follow the process in `SECURITY.md` instead.

## Feature Requests
- Use the “Feature request” template to explain the business context, expected behavior, and any proposal ideas.
- For complex ideas, consider starting a GitHub Discussion or community thread before filing a formal Issue.

## Urgent Communication
- For production-impacting incidents, open an Issue and tag it with `priority/high`; maintainers will triage as quickly as possible.

## Contributing & Review
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you plan to submit code.
- PRs that include tests, docs, and a change summary move through review faster.

Thank you for supporting and using Soffio!
