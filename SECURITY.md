# Security Policy

English | [中文](SECURITY.zh.md)

We take the security of Soffio and its users seriously. If you discover a potential vulnerability, please follow the process below and avoid sharing details in public channels.

## How to Report
- Use GitHub Security Advisories (the repository exposes the “Report a vulnerability” button once enabled).
  - Include the affected component or path.
  - Provide reproduction steps.
  - Describe the impact (e.g., DoS, data exposure, privilege escalation).
  - Optional: attach a proof of concept or remediation suggestion.

## Response Targets
- **Within 24 hours**: acknowledge receipt.
- **Within 72 hours**: share an initial assessment and next steps.
- **Within 7 days**: deliver a fix or mitigation plan and coordinate disclosure timing.

Please keep reports confidential until a fix is released. If you need coordinated disclosure or aligned announcements, let us know when you report the issue.

## Security Updates
- Fixes ship through the standard release pipeline and are noted in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Critical advisories are also highlighted in the corresponding GitHub Release notes.

Thank you for helping us keep Soffio secure.
